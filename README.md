# webscraping-dataanalysis

In this challenge full web-scraping and data analysis is done. 

I have learned to identify HTML elements on a page, their id and class attributes, and used this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. 

I have also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

This assignment consists of two technical products:

- Deliverable 1: Scraping titles and previewing text from Mars news articles.

- Deliverable 2: Scraping and analyzing Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
